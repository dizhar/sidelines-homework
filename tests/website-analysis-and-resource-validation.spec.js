/**
 * Website Analysis and Validation Task
 *
 * Brief Explanation of Approach:
 *
 * 1. **Performance, SEO, Accessibility, and Best Practices Analysis**:
 *    - The script uses Lighthouse to evaluate a given website's performance, SEO, accessibility, and adherence to best practices.
 *    - Scores for each category are extracted and saved in a report for further analysis.
 *    - Reports are stored as JSON files and attached to Playwright test results for easy access.
 *
 * 2. **Resource Validation**:
 *    - The script validates all linked resources (CSS, JS, images) on the webpage to ensure no broken links or missing assets.
 *    - Any broken resources are logged and attached to the test report.
 *    - If any broken resources are found, the test fails with a detailed log.
 *
 * 3. **Reusable and Modular Design**:
 *    - Key functionalities like resource collection, Lighthouse score extraction, and error logging are abstracted into helper functions.
 *    - This ensures code maintainability and reusability across other tests.
 *
 * How This Script Can Help Monitor Websites Over Time:
 *
 * - **Consistent Monitoring**:
 *   - By running this script periodically, teams can monitor the website's performance, SEO, accessibility, and best practices.
 *   - It helps identify regressions or areas for improvement over time.
 *
 * - **Broken Resource Detection**:
 *   - Detects and logs any broken resources or missing assets, ensuring the website remains functional and user-friendly.
 *
 * - **Historical Data**:
 *   - Saved reports serve as historical records to track progress and improvements.
 *
 * - **Automated Alerts**:
 *   - Test failures act as automated alerts, prompting immediate action to resolve issues before they affect users.
